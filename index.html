            <p><span classs="lead">Zach, like many dev bootcamp students, has a diverse and non-linear career history.  Zach has had a lifelong interest in studing systems and logical interactions, and has finally made the commitment to jump full time into studying development.</span></p>
            <p>After dropping out of his first attempt to get a degree in hard sciences, Zach found himself working in the service industry.  He quickly discovered a knack for working with people.  Over the next few years, he finished a B.S. in Economics and climbed the management ladder working in retail operations.  His interest in behavioral and business systems led him to transition to work in Human Resources.  He grew to manage HR for a retail unit with 200+ staff and eventually left as an HR business partner for a small business consultancy.</p>
            <p>Although he loved the systems-thinking necessary for strategic HR work, Zach wanted to work in a field that was more open to creativity and exploration.  He chose web development because it lives on the border between technical and behavioral systems and allows interesing and creative work with both.</p>
            <p>Zach is a 4th genreation Portland native and has lived here almost his whole life.  He lives in north portland with his wife, two cats, and some chickens.  You can find him browsing in the Kenton library most weekends.</p>

            <h4>Interests</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Coding and Development: Well, obviously.  Especially interested in learning the underlying structures of how data is moved and interpreted.</li>
              <li>Cooking: And eating.  10+ years in food service has made Zach pretty creative in the kitchen.  Zach could talk about food all day.</li>
              <li>Board Games: Zach loves complicated, hours-long board games.  Current favorites are Eldritch Horror, Eclipse, and Pandemic Legacy</li>
              <li>Pop music: Zach has very eclectic music taste, but most of it was considered pop at one time or another.  From classic 60's soul to modern overproduced garbage.</li>
              <li>Reading: Zach generally has his nose in a book. Yep, a book on paper.  Most reading is about either scientists writing popular accounts of their work or sarcastic spaceship captains.  Or dense nautical fiction.  That stuff is great.</li>
